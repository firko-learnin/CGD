# CGD - Coffee Grind Database

## Update:

I am currently rewriting this app in React after originally making it with vanilla JS.

## Info:

To keep up coding over the Christmas break from the School of Code I decided to create a coffee grind tracking app as espresso is a personal hobby of mine.

I used Express.js to create a REST API using a Heroku PostgreSQL database.

Current functionality:

- Post recipes
- Search by machine/grinder/roaster
- Delete recipes

Hosted on Heroku: https://coffeegrinddatabase.herokuapp.com/

## To do:

- Add the ability to update recipes in the database
- Add account creation
- Convert to a React app
