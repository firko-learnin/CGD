# CGD - Coffee Grind Database

A full stack app for coffee enthusiasts to share espresso/filter coffee recipes. I created this app as a Christmas project after 6 weeks at School of Code using HTML, CSS and vanilla JS for the front end and an Express back end.

The app is deployed on Heroku using a PostgreSQL database to store recipes.

I am currently in the process of rewriting this app using NextJS and TypeScript (see React-rewrite branch).

I used Express.js to create a REST API using a Heroku PostgreSQL database.

Current functionality:

- Post recipes
- Search by machine/grinder/roaster
- Delete recipes

Hosted on Heroku: https://coffeegrinddatabase.herokuapp.com/

## To do:

- Add the ability to update recipes in the database
- Add account creation
- Convert to a React app
