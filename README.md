# CGD - Coffee Grind Database

To keep up coding over the Christmas break from the School of Code I decided to create a coffee grind tracking app as espresso is a personal hobby of mine.

I used Express.js to create a REST API using a Heroku PostgreSQL database.

Current functionality:

* Post recipes
* Search by machine/grinder/roaster
* Delete recipes

Hosted on Heroku: https://coffeegrinddatabase.herokuapp.com/

## To do:

* Add the ability to update recipes in the database
* Add account creation
